		<p style="font-size: 135%;"> We are proud to showcase our esteemed partnerships with local Madison establishments that significantly
            contribute to our mission. A cornerstone of our collaboration is with <a href="https://www.uwbookstore.com/home">The University Book Store</a>, which
            graciously hosts our mission box on the west side of their building. Their generosity extends further
            as they provide financial support to our organization, enabling us to continue our impactful work.
            Additionally, we are honored to partner with <a href="https://shop.capcentremarket.com/">Capitol Centre Market</a>, a vital ally in our fight against
            hunger. They generously donate non-perishable food items to our cause and offer us special discounts on
            food purchases, allowing us to stock the box at sustainable prices!</p>
