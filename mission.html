        <p style="font-size: 130%;"> <i> We are Mission Box-UW Madison, a new student led organization here on campus! Our club was started 
            with inspiration from the national organization Freedge, and our goal is to lower food insecurity in the Madison area. 
            Our mission revolves around our strategically located Mission Box, a source of non-perishable food items and water that 
            is freely available to all who need it. Additionally, we welcome members of the community to donate their own non-perishable
             items and/or water, to bridge the gap between the University and residential community of Madison. We also strive to eliminate
              the stigmatization of people experiencing food insecurity by allowing people to grab their own food rather than serving it to
               them. </i></p>
